## Getting Started

Chef Infra is a configuration management tool designed to bring automation to your entire infrastructure.

### Want to try Chef Infra?

For Chef Infra usage please refer to our [Learn Chef Rally](https://learn.chef.io/) website, which includes module based training for Chef Infra as well as Automate, Habitat, and InSpec.

Other useful resources for Chef Infra users:

- Documentation: <https://docs.chef.io>
- Source: <https://github.com/chef/chef/tree/master>

## Reporting Issues

Issues can be reported by using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chef/chef/issues).

Full details on how to report issues can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-chef-issue-tracking) doc.

Note that this repository is primarily for reporting issues in the chef-client itself. For reporting issues against other Chef projects, please look up the appropriate repository to report issues against in the Chef docs in the [community contributions section](https://docs.chef.io/community_contributions.html#issues-and-bug-reports).
If you can't determine the appropriate place to report an issue, then please open it against the repository you think best fits and it will be directed to the appropriate project.

## Contributing/Development

Please read our [Community Contributions Guidelines](https://docs.chef.io/community_contributions.html), and ensure you are signing all your commits with DCO sign-off.

The general development process is:

1. Fork this repo and clone it to your workstation.
2. Create a feature branch for your change.
3. Write code and tests.
4. Push your feature branch to GitHub and open a pull request against master.

Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code. We do utilize RSpec for test driven development, so you'll need to get a development environment running. Follow the above procedure ("Installing from Git") to get your local copy of the source running.

## Testing

This repository uses rspec for testing.

```bash
# all tests
bundle exec rspec

# single test
bundle exec rspec spec/PATH/TO/FILE_spec.rb

# all tests under a subdir
bundle exec rspec spec/PATH/TO/DIR
```

When you submit a PR rspec tests will run automatically on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/).


# How Chef Builds and Versions

Chef is an amalgam of many components. These components update all the time, necessitating new builds. This is an overview of the process of versioning, building and releasing Chef.

## Chef Packages

Chef is distributed as packages for debian, rhel, ubuntu, windows, solaris, aix, and macos. It includes a large number of components from various sources, and these are versioned and maintained separately from the chef project, which bundles them all together conveniently for the user.

These packages go through several milestones:
- `master`: When code is checked in to master, the patch version of chef is bumped (e.g. 14.5.1 -> 14.5.2) and a build is kicked off automatically to create and test the packages in Chef's internal CI cluster.
- `unstable`: When a package is built, it enters the unstable channel. When all packages for all OS's have successfully built, the test phase is kicked off in Jenkins across all supported OS's. These builds are password-protected and generally only available to the test systems.
- `current`: If the packages pass all the tests on all supported OS's, it is promoted as a unit to `current`, and is available by running `curl https://www.chef.io/chef/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -c current -P chef` or at <https://downloads.chef.io/chef/current>
- `stable`: Periodically, Chef will pick a release to "bless" for folks who would like a slower update schedule than "every time a build passes the tests." When this happens, it is manually promoted to stable and an announcement is sent to the list. It can be reached at <https://downloads.chef.io> or installed using the `curl` command without specifying `-c current`. Packages in `stable` are no longer available in `current`.

Additionally, periodically Chef will update the desired versions of chef components and check that in to `master`, triggering a new build with the updated components in it.

## Automated Version Bumping

Whenever a change is checked in to `master`, the patch version of `chef` is bumped. To do this, the `chef-ci` bot listens to GitHub for merged PRs, and when it finds one, takes these actions:

1. Bumps the patch version (e.g. 14.1.14 -> 14.1.15) by running ./ci/version_bump.sh
2. Updates the changelog with the new pull request and current point release
3. Pushes to `master` and submits a new build to Chef's Jenkins cluster.


## Component Versions

Chef has two sorts of component: ruby components like `berkshelf` and `test-kitchen`, and binary components like `openssl` and even `ruby` itself.

In general, you can find all chef desired versions in the [Gemfile](Gemfile) and [omnibus_overrides.rb](omnibus_overrides.rb) files. The [Gemfile.lock](Gemfile.lock) is the locked version of the Gemfile.

### Binary Components

The versions of binary components (as well as rubygems and bundler, which can't be versioned in a Gemfile) are stored in [omnibus_overrides.rb](omnibus_overrides.rb).

These have software definitions either in [omnibus/config/software](omnibus/config/software) or, more often, in the [omnibus-software](https://github.com/chef/omnibus-software/tree/master/config/software) project.

### Rubygems Components

Our rubygems component versions are locked down with `Gemfile.lock`, and can be updated with `bundle update` or `rake dependencies:update_gemfile_lock`.

### Build Tooling Versions

The external environment necessary to build omnibus (compilers, make, git, etc) is configured by the [opscode-ci cookbook](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/opscode-ci) cookbook.  In order to reliably create omnibus builds that cookbook should be used to install the prerequisites.  It may be possible to install the latest version
of utilities on a suitably recent distribution and be able to build an omnibus package, but the necessary prerequisites will not be documented here.  In most
cases a recent MacOS with Xcode and a few homebrew packages or a recent Ubuntu distribution with packages like `build-essentials` should suffice.

### Test Versions

chef is tested by the [chef-acceptance framework](https://github.com/chef/chef-acceptance), which contains suites that are run on the Jenkins test machines. The definitions of the tests are in the `acceptance` directory. The version of chef-acceptance and test-kitchen, are governed by `acceptance/Gemfile`.

The test tooling versions are locked down with `acceptance/Gemfile.lock`, which can be updated by running `rake dependencies`.
